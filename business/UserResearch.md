# User Research Analysis

Observations utilizing the [data collected](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CiCBJkfqhDG8VCsA55x3Ggknxrd6l-75M_kXKQm4WkA/edit?gid=1076286620#gid=1076286620) from our initial user research survey.

## Observation 1:

Observation Statement: Users are concerned about personal safety when picking up or dropping off items.

Supporting Data: In a research survey, 50% of people said they were concerned with the safety of items and 45% said they were sometimes concerned with the safety of items.

Team Action: Add a verification feature and a item satisfaction history for each user on the platform. Users will also be able to message item listers prior to picking up an item. Hopefully the combination of features will reassure any concerns regarding product safety.

## Observation 2: 

Observation Statement: Users are not usually in the process of moving

Supporting Data: In the research survey, 3/21 participants said they were not actively moving

## Observation 3:

Observation Statement: Even though 16/21 people are not currently looking to downsize or clear out items, people would be encouraged to declutter more regularly if they knew items were going to someone who could use them?

Supporting Data: 13 out of the 16 people who are not looking to declutter said they would be encouraged to declutter more often if they were going to people who needed them.
